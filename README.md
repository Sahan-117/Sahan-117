     Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is often credited as the world's first computer programmer.
     In the mid-1800s, she wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
     This was long before the advent of modern computers!
